### ABOUT ME
I have over 7 years of experience as a chief accountant. I worked with financial reports, tax systems, and business operations. I am responsible, detail-oriented, and always follow deadlines.

Now I am changing my career to become a frontend developer. I enjoy learning new things and solving problems. I am studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I also practice using Visual Studio Code and GitHub.

My goal is to work in IT, where I can combine my logical thinking and strong attention to detail with new technical skills. I am motivated, disciplined, and ready for challenges.
